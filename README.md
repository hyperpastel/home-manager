This repository houses my Home-Manager configuration. It is [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)-based and uses Home Manager as [standalone](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-flakes-standalone).

## üß± Structure

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è home.nix

This file contains the bulk of the configuration and is intended as the entry point. Within is basic information home manager needs for 
it's management, as well as several simple configurations for various programs.

### üìÅ modules

This folder contains more elaborate configurations for various software I use. Each file name corresponds to the application being configured in that file.
